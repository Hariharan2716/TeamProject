Prompt:
“How can I make my header stay at the top while scrolling and style it with a background and shadow?”

Suggested CSS to add:

css
Copy
Edit
header {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  background-color: white;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  padding: 15px 30px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  z-index: 1000;
}

nav a {
  margin: 0 10px;
  text-decoration: none;
  color: #333;
  font-weight: bold;
}

nav a:hover {
  color: #ff6f61;
}

Reflection:

This prompt helped me understand how sticky positioning works differently from fixed positioning. It was a simple yet powerful enhancement to improve site navigation. Styling the header also gave it a more polished, branded feel. I now feel more confident using sticky elements in layouts.
